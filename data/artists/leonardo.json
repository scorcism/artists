      "Born in Vinci in 1452, Leonardo da Vinci embodied the Renaissance ideal of universal knowledge. He pursued mastery in art, science, engineering, anatomy, architecture, and countless other fields with equal passion and revolutionary insight. His curiosity knew no bounds, his notebooks reveal a mind centuries ahead of its time.",
      "Leonardo approached art with scientific rigor and science with artistic vision. He dissected corpses to understand anatomy, studied birds to design flying machines, and observed water to paint landscapes. His method of inquiry—observation, experimentation, documentation—was as revolutionary as his creations.",
      "Though he completed relatively few paintings, works like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper remain among humanity's most iconic images. His notebooks, filled with inventions from helicopters to tanks, from scuba gear to robots, demonstrate an intellect that transcended his era. Leonardo didn't just contribute to the Renaissance—he defined what it meant to be a complete human being."
