      "Born in Caprese in 1475, Michelangelo Buonarroti emerged as the supreme artist of the High Renaissance. His unparalleled mastery of sculpture, painting, and architecture redefined human artistic possibility and shaped the cultural trajectory of Western civilization.",
      "A perfectionist obsessed with unveiling the divine within marble, Michelangelo saw sculpture as liberation— the act of freeing the imprisoned figure from its stone tomb. This philosophy transcended his work; it became his life's spiritual quest.",
      "From the iconic David to the transcendent Sistine Chapel, from the architectural majesty of St. Peter's to intimate marble Pietàs, Michelangelo's works stand as monuments to human potential at its absolute zenith."
